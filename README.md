# Pomorodo Timer

## Intention
As a person with ADHD, I have leaned on the Pomodoro Technique as a productivity tool for ages. I have used timers with my smart watch, YouTube videos, and countless other services. The idea, then, came to me to make a timer that combines all the different aspects of various timers into one, unified application. To minimize visual distraction/stimulation, the GUI is made simply with tkinter. Additionally, there are soft alert sounds that indicate the end of study sessions, short breaks, and long breaks. As a musician/dj, I will also incorporate original mixes as background music for days when I want some soft ambiance in the background. 

As I deepend my knowledge of Python, one of my focuses is expanding into the data analytics/science parts of the language. Thus, the idea to have this app track my productivity was born. Freshly stepping into my tech career, I am constantly trying to update and improve my working habits/rituals. So, by collecting timestamps of study sessions along with miscellaneous qualitative data about the users' day, I am working to implement data visualizations that present patterns in visualizations as to increase the effectiveness of these study sessions. 

As of October 2022, this app is early in development and commits are regularly being pushed to this application. For any questions/inquiries, please feel free to reach out.
